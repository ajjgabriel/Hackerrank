<p>John has discovered various rocks. Each rock is composed of various elements, and each element is represented by a lowercase latin letter from 'a' to 'z'. An element can be present multiple times in a rock. An element is called a 'gem-element' if it occurs at least once in each of the rocks.</p>

<p>Given the list of rocks with their compositions, display the number of gem-elements that exist in those rocks.</p>

Print the number of gem-elements that are common in these rocks.  </p>

<p><strong>Constraints</strong> <br>
1 ≤ N ≤ 100 <br>
Each composition consists of only small latin letters ('a'-'z'). <br>
1 ≤ Length of each composition ≤ 100  </p>

<p><strong>Sample Input</strong>  </p>

<pre><code>3
